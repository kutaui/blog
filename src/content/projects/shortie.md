title: 'Shortie'
description: 'Shortie is an URL shortening app where you can shorten your links, see the related data with beatiful and customizable analytics dashboard and get realtime notifications. Other than known stuff, I used Framer Motion, dnd-kit and likes of Recharts. Backend is built with Go std library, also used Redis for caching and PostgreSQL for the database. I am hosting this on my personal VPS with Docker and Traefik. I used GitHub actions for CI/CD.'
